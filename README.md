# My website

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/4e427f85-32d7-4504-af75-67ff0241c4b7/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/germanfrelo/deploys)

This site is built using:

- **HTML**, of course.
- **CSS**, following the CSS methodology [**CUBE CSS**](https://cube.fyi).
- [**Eleventy (11ty)**](https://www.11ty.dev) as the Static Site Generator.
- [**Netlify**](https://www.netlify.com) for deployment.
- A lot of ideas from a lot of cool people.

## Deployment

The site is auto-deployed on Netlify from the default (`main`) branch on GitHub. Deploys are automated on push to `main`.

Use branches and PRs for changes, and Netlify will create staging previews for functional review before merge.
